# BBC iPlayer
A BBC iPlayer Web App prototype

## Introduction
You will find explanations regarding the workflow for this project below. It summarize what we talked about during our first production meeting and it should be read before jumping in to make sure that everything goes smoothly during the development process.

### Skeleton
A skeleton was created for you to branch off. It is heavily commented and should clearly define the space in which your feature will be implemented. This is done in order to avoid merge errors during pull request when the time comes. If you have any question regarding the comments left in the index.hmtl, come talk to me on Slack. It is important for everyone to understand this as it should keep us away from too much trouble when putting together everyone's work.

### Naming your branch
Name your branch accordingly to the "Issue"/feature you are working on: hero, search, carousel... Always be extremely careful to work on your branch and not one of another collaborator.

### JavaScript
 A separate file should be made for every feature developped which require JavaScript. Name it accordingly to the feature (i.e "search.js" for the search feature).

### jQuery
The latest version of jQuery (3.3.1) is hosted in the repository folder "js" and already in the skeleton's HTML header. Keep that version number in mind if you are searching for solutions. We could use a CDN but having it hosted here means allowing for offling development.

### Bugs & Errors
There is nothing wrong with having a look at other people's work/branches (it is even encouraged) but don't widly change their codes. Instead go to the issue related to the feature they are developing and refer to the code/commit which contain the error in the comments so the contributor can rectify it

### Pull request
The master branch is locked and the only way to add your content to it will be through submitting a pull request. You can submit pull request as you are developing your feature, whoever make sure that your code is clean and up to standard when you do so (indenting, syntax, alt...).

If you have any question regarding pull request you can learn more about them at the [following link](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) (give it a try, I promise it is simple)
