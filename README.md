### About the Project

Following on from the [SilverNote](https://github.com/louisefindlay23/silvernote) project, we were assigned to create a mobile web app prototype for BBC iPlayer. We divided the website into eight sections and took two each. Once the skeleton was created, I worked on the carousel and search areas.

As it was a mobile app, the carousel had to be touch-friendly so I used the plugin, [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co) which was easy to use and very customisable. When the TV Show section was complete, it was integrated together so clicking on a cell showed metadata from the TVDB.

Originally, the search section was meant to be a prototype because our host, Github Pages didn't allow databases. However, I was still determined to get it work. I used a mixture of jQuery and JavaScript to create a dropdown menu with filterFunction which would narrow down search results when typed. I also added a check in jQuery to see if search history already exists and add the name of the show visted underneath it.
